    <p>The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is under military occupation. Palestinians face daily restrictions on movement due to hundreds of checkpoints, a segregated road system, and the separation wall — which often cuts through Palestinian land and neighborhoods.</p>
    <p>In Jerusalem, Palestinian residents are subjected to home demolitions, residency revocations, and police violence. The Israeli government has pursued policies aimed at altering the demographic balance of the city in favor of Jewish residents.</p>
    <p>Religious freedom is also restricted, with Palestinians facing limited access to sites like Al-Aqsa Mosque, especially during religious holidays.</p>
