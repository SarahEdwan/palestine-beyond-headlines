    <p>Since 2007, Israel has imposed a blockade on Gaza, restricting the movement of goods and people. This blockade has led to a humanitarian crisis, with shortages of clean water, electricity, and medical supplies.</p>
    <p>Gaza has experienced repeated military assaults, including large-scale operations in 2008-09, 2012, 2014, and 2021. These offensives resulted in thousands of civilian casualties and the destruction of critical infrastructure such as hospitals and schools.</p>
    <p>Today, over 2 million Palestinians live in Gaza, with over 80% reliant on humanitarian aid. The siege has created conditions widely described as unlivable.</p>
